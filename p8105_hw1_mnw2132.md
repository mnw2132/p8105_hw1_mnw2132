## Problem 1

**Download the package and load the dataset**
install.packages(“palmerpenguins”)

data(“penguins”, package = “palmerpenguins”)

**Description of penguins data set**

*Data in the set, including names/values of important variables*

The columns names are species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm,
flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, year.

An overall summary of the data includes Adelie :152 , Chinstrap: 68 ,
Gentoo :124 , NA, NA, NA, NA, Biscoe :168 , Dream :124 , Torgersen: 52 ,
NA, NA, NA, NA, Min. :32.10 , 1st Qu.:39.23 , Median :44.45 , Mean
:43.92 , 3rd Qu.:48.50 , Max. :59.60 , NA’s :2 , Min. :13.10 , 1st
Qu.:15.60 , Median :17.30 , Mean :17.15 , 3rd Qu.:18.70 , Max. :21.50 ,
NA’s :2 , Min. :172.0 , 1st Qu.:190.0 , Median :197.0 , Mean :200.9 ,
3rd Qu.:213.0 , Max. :231.0 , NA’s :2 , Min. :2700 , 1st Qu.:3550 ,
Median :4050 , Mean :4202 , 3rd Qu.:4750 , Max. :6300 , NA’s :2 ,
female:165 , male :168 , NA’s : 11 , NA, NA, NA, NA, Min. :2007 , 1st
Qu.:2007 , Median :2008 , Mean :2008 , 3rd Qu.:2009 , Max. :2009 , NA.

*Size of the data* The data set includes 344 rows, made up of individual
penguins, and 8 columns, made up of different variables.

*Mean flipper length* The mean flipper length is 200.9152047.

**Make a scatterplot** install.packages(“ggplot2”) library(ggplot2)

*Create a data frame containing variables for our plot.*

``` r
ggplot (data=penguins, aes(x= bill_length_mm, y= flipper_length_mm, color=species))+geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

``` r

```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

## Problem 2

**Create the data frame**

``` r
Q2 <- tibble(
  randomsample = rnorm(10),
  greater_than_zero = rnorm(10) > 0,
  character = letters[1:10],
  factor = factor(rep(c("Level_1","Level_2","Level_3"), length.out = 10)))
```

**Calculate the means**

``` r
mean(pull(Q2,randomsample))
```

    ## [1] 0.1530886

``` r
mean(pull(Q2,greater_than_zero))
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(pull(Q2,character))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(Q2, character)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(Q2,factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(Q2, factor)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Considering that the mean for the character vector and the factor vector
cannot be calculated and received an answer of “NA”, because they are
not numeric, we can calculate them using as.numeric as follows.

**as.numeric to logical, character and factor variables**

``` r
mean(as.numeric(pull(Q2,greater_than_zero)))
mean(as.numeric(pull(Q2,character)))
mean(as.numeric(pull(Q2,factor)))
```

The logical variables get coded as 1 or 0, which causes the mean=0.5.
Meanwhile, the factor variable can get coded in regard to the levels of
1-3, thereby creating a mean close to 2. However, the character
variables get changed into NA’s by coercion, therefore a mean still
cannot be calculate as the variables are NA.
